    During my time at Mar Baselios I learnt most of my key skills that I have taken through my post college life such as working smarter, harder, waking up at 4 was quite a big deal for me, working out physically and submiting projects to tight deadlines obviously. I came to understand a lot about a healthy work life balance and the positions i will be put in at this stage of life.

    I spend most of my after hour sections in training soccer for the college team. My team is something I am proud of forever. Late nights would mostly be making websites as well as learning better coding skills.
